Shopee competition, too bad I had wrong format, geez

 in submission.csv:
- 0 in column *-userid-* : shop in *-shopid-* column is not a cheater
 
- non-zero in column *-userid-* : shop in *-shopid-* column is a order booster, with the fake buyers listed in *-userid-* column. If the number of fake buyers is more than one, there will be an `'&'` between fake buyers
