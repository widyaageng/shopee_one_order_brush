# shopee_one_order_brush
Shopee competition, too bad I had wrong format, geez

 in submission.csv:
- 0 in column **_userid_** : shop in **_shopid_** column is not a cheater
 
- non-zero in column **_userid_** : shop in **_shopid_** column is a order booster, with the fake buyers listed in **_userid_** column. If the number of fake buyers is more than one, there will be an `'&'` between fake buyers
